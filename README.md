Project about the paper: Looplessness in networks is linked to trophic coherence by S Johnson 

The data used correspond to the one by Jhonsson. The main notebook where all the data can find is called:

"Looplessness - Original Dataset" where we implemented and compute topological properties of directed graphs such as looplessles regime, non normalization matriced, strong connectiviy graph and show the correlation among them and also with the trophic coherence parameter.

The notebook "Comparison Basal Ensemble" consist on the implementation of a directed configuration ensemble which is then compared with the analitical solutions find in the paper.

In the trophic level graph we plot several networks according to the trophic coherence parameter.

In Pref_preying_model the preferential preying model is applied and analized also in the remain notebooks.
